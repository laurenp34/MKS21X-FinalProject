Kiran-Familiarized myself with Google GSON library and built rudimentary code for inputting a search term and receiving relevant data from OpenLibrary\
Lauren-Downloaded Lanterna and Mr. K's TerminalDemo. Figured out differences between Windows and the computers at school for Lanterna (-cp is different). Looked into TextBox as a possible class for inputting the search term.
