*3 January 2019*\
Kiran-Familiarized myself with Google GSON library and built rudimentary code for inputting a search term and receiving relevant data from OpenLibrary\
Lauren-Downloaded Lanterna and Mr. K's TerminalDemo. Figured out differences between Windows and the computers at school for Lanterna (-cp is different). Looked into TextBox as a possible class for inputting the search term.

Lauren-was sick :(\

*5 January 2019*\
Kiran-\
Lauren-Created Search program which generates a search message at the top of the terminal and stores the input as a string. Also worked on creating a class structure (because I originally wrote everything in the main). \

*6 January 2019*\
Kiran-\
Lauren-Worked on fixing the usage of the program. For example, clearing the terminal screen and exiting the program. Also familiarized myself with TerminalScreen in Lanterna.\

*7 Janary 2019*\
Kiran-\
Lauren-Merged my search branch with master, which meant merging the two Search.java files. So far, my Search.java was focused on retrieving user input, whereas Kiran's was focused on using a given String (search term) and searching through the json file for matches. I combined our two files and wrote a method that prints out the results of the search, by passing the string generated from user input into Kiran's search methods. (the method doesn't work 100% yet)
